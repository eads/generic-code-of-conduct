# Generic code of conduct

A generic code of conduct based on the [GeekFeminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) and [FreeGeek Chicago](https://github.com/freegeekchicago/fgc-docs/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) codes.

It is distributed under the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 license and is in the public domain.

The code can be read [here](code-of-conduct.md).

## Why another code of conduct template?

Most codes of conduct are focused on conferences and short-term events. This code is meant to accommodate a wider range of activities, like open source projects and on-going volunteer programs.

It includes political views in its definition of harassment and explicitly discusses principles of nonviolence.

It includes a consensus mechanism by which potentially dangerous situations can be de-escalated, as well as a provision determining the long-term consequences of code violations.

Codes of conduct are only as good as their enforcement. This code of conduct assumes:

* The code will be clearly communicated to all participants of the group, project, or event.
* A group designated to handle violations.
* A paper or digital reporting mechanism as appropriate for the event/project/organization/venue.
* A way of reporting violations and actions taken in response back to the larger community.
* Organizers pledge to support victims fully and seek rehabilitation as appropriate for violators of the code of conduct.
